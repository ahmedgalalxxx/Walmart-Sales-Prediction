# Walmart Sales Prediction [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ahmedgalalxxx/Walmart-Sales-Prediction/blob/main/Walmart_Sales_Prediction_Colab.ipynb) A machine learning project to predict Walmart weekly sales based on various features including store information, holiday flags, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates. **Quick Start:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge above to run the complete project in your browser. ## Project Overview This project uses historical sales data from Walmart stores to build predictive models that can forecast future weekly sales. The dataset includes multiple features that influence sales patterns. ## Dataset The dataset (`Walmart.csv`) contains 6,435 records with the following features: - **Store**: Store number identifier
- **Date**: Week of sales (MM-DD-YYYY format)
- **Weekly_Sales**: Sales for the given store in that week (Target Variable)
- **Holiday_Flag**: Binary indicator (1 if special holiday week, 0 otherwise)
- **Temperature**: Average temperature in the region (°F)
- **Fuel_Price**: Cost of fuel in the region ($/gallon)
- **CPI**: Consumer Price Index
- **Unemployment**: Unemployment rate (%) ## Getting Started ### Prerequisites - Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager ### Installation 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedgalalxxx/Walmart-Sales-Prediction.git
cd Walmart-Sales-Prediction
``` 2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` ### Running the Project 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Open and run `01_EDA.ipynb`
2. **Model Training**: Open and run `02_Model_Training.ipynb`
3. **Make Predictions**: Use `predict.py` for new predictions ## Project Structure ```

``` ## Methodology ### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data quality assessment
- Statistical analysis of features
- Visualization of sales patterns
- Correlation analysis
- Holiday impact analysis ### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Date feature extraction (year, month, week, day)
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling/normalization
- Train-test split ### 3. Feature Engineering
- Time-based features (seasonal patterns)
- Lag features (previous week's sales)
- Rolling statistics (moving averages)
- Interaction features ### 4. Model Development
Multiple regression models are implemented and compared:
- **Linear Regression** (Baseline)
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor** ### 5. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ## Results The best performing models and their metrics will be documented here after training. ## Technologies Used - **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and utilities
- **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting
- **Jupyter**: Interactive notebooks ## Key Insights Key insights from the analysis will be documented here, including:
- Holiday impact on sales
- Seasonal patterns
- Store-specific trends
- Economic factors influence ## Contributing Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. ## License This project is open source and available under the MIT License. ## Author **Ahmed Galal**
