## üîÑ Regenerating Visualizations

To create/update all visualizations:

```bash
python create_visualizations.py
```

This will regenerate all 9 visualization files in the `results/` folder.

## üìä Key Insights from Visualizations

### Sales Patterns:
- Sales show strong seasonality with peaks during holiday periods
- Average weekly sales: ~$1,050,000
- Holiday sales are generally higher than non-holiday sales

### Model Performance:
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (96.20% R¬≤)
- All models show good generalization (no overfitting)
- Predictions are accurate with low error rates

### Important Features:
- Lag features (previous week sales) are most important
- Store ID is a strong predictor
- Economic factors (CPI, Unemployment) have moderate impact

### Store Insights:
- Top stores significantly outperform average
- High variability across different stores
- Consistent data collection across all stores
